This experiment assigns the values [1.0nm, 1.5nm, 2.0nm] to the
        thicknesses to the dielectric and ferroelectro layers of a FerroX stack and creates a
        directory for each combination (total of 9) with all the files necessary to run each simulation.
        It keeps the domain cell size constant.
